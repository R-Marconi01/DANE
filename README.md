# DANE 

DANE is a software tool created to assist Renewable Energy Communities. It notarizes the energy flows within a community on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security. DANE collects data from home smart meters and publishes it on the Solana blockchain. Our web app also presents comprehensive and interesting data to the community users, helping them manage their collaboration efficiently.
